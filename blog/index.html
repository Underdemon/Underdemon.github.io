            <p>this is a very minimal start to a blog</p>
            <p>ive been meaning to do this for a while but im in the middle of my a levels and its pretty painful</p>
            <p>plus, one year ago today is the day my good friend technica started <a href="https://technica.eth.limo/blog/">his own blog</a>, and i thought it would be cute if i started my own on this momentous occastion</p>
            <p>I will actually update this so it looks nice and the so i say something meaningful, but after my physics and math exams I have on 24th of may and 25th of may respectively</p>
