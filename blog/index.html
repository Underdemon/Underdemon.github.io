        <h1>the temporary (maybe permanent) death of reddit + exams</h1>

        <div class = "entrytext">
            <p>so i've done 5 exams so far (core pure 1 & 2, physics paper 1 & 2 and single math pure year 1) and its been a mixed bag so far (other than single math that was EZ)</p>
            <p>and at this point i'm beginning to get burnt out. exams are difficult what can i say. but all i have is 9 days and im done, free to finally do stuff with my friends</p>
            <p>tho thats another problem, getting my friends to do stuff means timetabling and i fear that they just dont want to do anything b4 i leave on holiday</p>
            <br>
            <p>on another note, reddit has a blackout/might be dead</p>
            <p>while this is prob pretty good for that social media addiction, i have been looking at alternatives like kbin and lemmy (which are in the fediverse)</p>
            <p>ill prob get into one of them as well as mastodon, tho i wanna research the fediverse first</p>
            <p>anyways im half dead and will prob maybe do some sane, well written posts at some point in the future. but until then, i'll CYA later</p>

        <h1>the start of the blog</h1>

        <div class = "entrytext">
            <p>this is a very minimal start to a blog</p>
            <p>ive been meaning to do this for a while but im in the middle of my a levels and its pretty painful</p>
            <p>plus, one year ago today is the day my good friend technica started <a href="https://technica.eth.limo/blog/">his own blog</a>, and i thought it would be cute if i started my own on this momentous occastion</p>
            <p>I will actually update this so it looks nice and the so i say something meaningful, but after my physics and math exams I have on 24th of may and 25th of may respectively</p>
